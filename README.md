## Application details
- This is Hangman.

## Instructions
 - A random word is chosen to start the game.
 - Choose a letter that you think is in the word.
    - If the letter is in the word,
      You are one step closer to solving the word.
    - If the letter is not in the word,
      You will get a new piece of the man in the noose.
- Reveal the word to gain a win score.
- You have 5 chances to avoid hanging and freeing your man.
- Run out of chances and your man will end up in the noose.

## Coding styles
I used two different styles to code the HTML.
- * JavaScript to perform loops, "if" statements, and a couple of getElemnetById's.
- * jQuery to make use of an easy to use catalog of options of changing the *HTML.

## Screenshots
Two screenshots.
- Mobile screenshots on the left and right

## Contributions
Contributions to the word bank are accepted. Please use all capital letters to maintain the ease of comparing inside the actual code.
If you have a design suggestion, I stayed with a simple Black & White design and will accept any improvements along those color lines.
If you have *Xcode experience and can make it accessible for iOS users if would be appreciated.
